<hr>

12/7 - fixed a minor typo in one of the helper functions that affects the output (had < instead of >)

To use this application you simply enter a gene name, the cDNA coordinates of a mutation in that gene and
the WT and Mutant bases then hit submit.
e.g. CDKL5 c.2152 G>A
Note: gene names are case sensitive

The output page will give you links to information about the gene
and mutation as well as a prediction of whether or not it could be treated with antisense oligonucleotide
gene therapy.
